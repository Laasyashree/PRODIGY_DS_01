# 🌍 PRODIGY_DS_01 - World Population Visualization

This project is part of the **PRODIGY Data Science Internship** program.  
We use Python to explore and visualize the **World Population dataset**, highlighting key insights through:

### 📊 Visualizations
- 📌 Bar Chart: Number of countries per continent
- 📌 Histogram: 2022 Population distribution
- 📌 Histogram: Growth rate of countries
- 📌 Histogram: Area (in km²)

### 📁 Files in This Repository

### ✅ Output Insights
- Most countries are in **Africa**, followed by Asia and Europe.
- Population is heavily **right-skewed** due to a few highly populous countries.
- Most countries have a **growth rate near 1**, indicating slow but steady growth.
- Land area also shows large variance — few large, many small.
